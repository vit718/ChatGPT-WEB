ChatGPT-web is a simple one-page web interface to the OpenAI ChatGPT API. To use it, you need to register for [an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) first. All messages are stored in your browser's local storage, so everything is **private**. You can also close the browser tab and come back later to continue the conversation.
